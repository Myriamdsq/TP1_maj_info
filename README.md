You are in the Myriam and Marie's Github. This is our Lab1, and the objective is develop a tiny shell, that displays exit codes and execution times of launched programs.

<div>

### 1. Display a welcome message, followed by a simple prompt.

To display the message, we create a string of caracters. We don't use 'printf' but 'write' to display the sentence.
We get the next message :

<div align="center">
<br>
<img src="Images/exercice1v2.jpeg" width="400"> </br>
</br> 
</div>

Moreover we can observe that if we are 'exit' after the prompt we exit the program. In the opposite if we have an another word, the program waits.

### 2. Execution of the entered command and return to the prompt.

The new programm waits after the prompt, a memorized function. We can test our program with differents functions as fortune, date ...
